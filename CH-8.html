    <h1>if, elif and else statement in Python</h1>
    
    <p>In python if, elif, else are used for decision making by using logical conditions from mathematics.</p>
    
    <h2>if</h2>
    
    <p>The 'if' is a keyword in python which saya if something is true then execute the following codes. We need an example to understand this. </p>
    
    <h3>Input :-</h3>
    
    <p>x = 40<br>
    y = 90100<br>
    if y > x :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(y, "is greater than", x)</p>
    
    <h3>Output :-</h3>
    
    <p>90100 is greater than 40</p>
    
    <h3>Logic behind this</h3>
    
    <p>Here we have used two variables, 'x' and 'y', which we have used as a part of if statement  to test wether y is greater than x or not. As value of x is 40 and value of y is 90100. Since this is true therefore we got print the statement print on screen that is 90100 is greater than 40. Here colon are very necessary with them you will get error. </p>
    
    <h3>Indentation :</h3>
    
    <p>Putting 4 whitespaces after the next line of the conditional statement. This helps python to understand that we want to get in that statement and execute the code. In other languages tthis is done by using curly brackets. If you don't put these four blank spaces then you not be able to execute the conditions present in that statement .</p>
    
    <h2>elif </h2>
    
    <p>The 'elif' is a keyword in python which says if the above condition is not true then execute the next conditional statement. We need an example to understand this.</p>
    
    <h3>Input :-</h3>
    
    <p>x = 400<br>
    y = 90<br>
    if y > x :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(y, "is greater than", x)<br>  
    elif x > y :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(x, "is greater than", y)<br></p>  
    
    <h3>Output :-</h3>
    
    <p>90100 is less than 40</p>
    
    <h2>else</h2>
    
    <p>The 'else' keyword executes it's code when the previos 'else' and 'elif' statements are not true. We need an example to understand this.</p>
    
    <h3>Input :-</h3>
    
    <p>x = 90<br>
    y = 90<br>
    if y > x :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(y, "is greater than", x)<br>  
    elif x > y :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(x, "is greater than", y)<br></p>
    else x == y :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(x, "is equal to", y)<br>
    
    <h3>Output :-</h3>
    
    <p>90 is equal to 90</p>
    
    <h2>pass statement in python </h2>
    
    <p>If you want the if statement to be empty then you have to use it becaues without pass statement python will give error. Example</p>
    
    <h3>Input :-</h3>
    
    <p>x = 90<br>
    y = 90<br>
    if y > x :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass<br>
    print("Hello World")</p>
    
    <h3>Output :-</h3>
    
    <p>Hello World</p>
