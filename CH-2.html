    <h1>Print<br>Comments<br>Expression<br>Statement<br>Blocks<br>Dynamic vs Static Typing</h1>    
    <h2>Print Statement In Python : </h2>
    
    <p>Print is an inbuilt function provided by python used to print any statement on output.It can print any value, variable, constant and list of variables.<br>Print Follows A Simple Syntax:</p>
    
    <p>>>>  print()<p>
    
    <p>To print any value we just need to write print, and the open parenthesis write the value you want to print and next close the parenthesis.<br>
    Now We Are Ready To Print Our First Statement:<br>
    Just type the following command in your workspace and run the program:<br></p>
    <p>>>>  print("Hello World")<br></p>
    <p>After running this program you will see a output which shows Hello World on the console. <br>
    As we all know that Hello World is a string so as to print this we need to put it between single or double quotes. If you don’t do that you will get error because the interpreter gets confused.</p>
    
    <h2>Printing a numeric Value : </h2>
    
    <p>To print numeric values you don’t need any quotes to put after and before the value. They can be print as shown below:<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>>>>  print(9)<p>
    
    <p>To print any variable, first you need to assign a value to the variable let say<br>
   >>> X = 78<br>
    >>> Y = “Learn to code”<br>
    Now you can easily print them by<br>
    >>> print(X, Y)<br></p>
    
    <h2>Source Code And Object Code : </h2>
    
    <p>The input which is written by a programmer is called Source code whereas the output from the console is called Object code.</p>
    
    <h2>Comments In Python : </h2>
    
        <p>Comments are additional readable information for pragrammers.Comments are lines of code in program which does not have any effect on Object code. It is generall used to clarify some lines of code like what this list is about and what this if statement do or what this loop  will do.<br> It has 2 types:<br><img src="play.png" width="10px" height="10px">  Single line comment<br><img src="play.png" width="10px" height="10px">  Multi-line comments.<br>
    <br><h3>Single line Comment</h3>  
        <p>A single line comment can be written by starting a line of code using #.<br>Example:<br>>>>  #Main program<br>>>>  #Program to calculate square<h3>Multi-line Comment</h3>
    <p>A multiline comment can be written by starting and ending a line of code using “””.<br>
    They are used to clarify the code as shown below:<br>
    '''  Program to find out the area and perimeter of<br>
        Circle<br>Rectangle<br>Square<br>This is what the program is'''</p>
    <h2>Expression</h2>
    <p>An expression is a set or combination of operators, literals and variables that represents a value.<br>For example: (a+b)-c, 2b*c, t+9, etc.</p>
    <h2>Statement</h2><p>Statements are the instructions that are executed by the Python's interpreter.
    <br>For example:<br>>>>  print("CodeWiz")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#This statement calls up print functions</p>
    <h2>Block</h2>
    <p>Blocks are group of statements which are part of another statement or a function in Python.<br>For example:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="fig3.png"height="180px" width="490px">
    <h1>Dynamic vs Static Typing</h1>
    <h2>Static Typing</h2>
        <p>When a variable is assigned to a value of one type then, it cannot be used to assign value of another type.</p>
    <h2>Dynamic Typing</h2>
        <p>When a variable is assigned to a value of one type then, the same variable can be used to assign value of anpther type. Python uses Dynamic typing. For example:<br>>>>  a=10<br>>>>  print(a)<br>>>>  a="Hello"<br>>>>  print(a)<br>Then the output will be :<br>10<br>Hello</p>
