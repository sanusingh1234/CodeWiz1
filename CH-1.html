    <h1>Introduction To Python</h1>
    <h2>Origin Of Python</h2>
    
      <p>Python has become a very popular programming language among beginners as well as developers. This programming language was developed by Dutch programmer named <i>Guido Van Rossum</i> in early 1990s at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was a successor of the ABC language. It was named after Rossum's favourite BBC comedy show,<i> Monty Python's Flying Circus</i>. Python is giving tough competition with popular languages like Java, C++, C#, etc. in poularity index.Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Learn Python?</h2>
    
    <p>1.Python is the one of the most easiest programming language to learn. It has a very simple syntax which is best for beginner programmers.<br><br>2.It has very friendly data structures which can be used for creating fast runtime data structures.<br><br>
    3.Python has built in third party modules (PyPI) which makes python capable of interacting with most of the other languages.<br><br>
    4.Python is a open source language so anyone can contribute towards its development.<br><br>
    5.Python supports large number of libraries which makes some tasks very simple, with less number of lines of code to write, and makes the work very fast.<br></p>
    
    
    <h2>Applications Of Python : </h2>
    
    <p>1.Python is used for web and internet development with frameworks like Django, Bottle, Plone and Flask. <br><br>
    2.Python is used in scientific and numeric computing using Scipy, Pandas and IPython.<br><br>
    3.Python is the future of machine learning you can use python to automate anything you want, like self driving car, robots and many more.<br><br>
    4.Used for creating softwares. Python offers multiple options for developing GUI(Graphical User Interface) like Tkinter and Kivy.<br><br>
    5.Python is also used for game development by using Pygame, Panda3D libraries.</p>
    
    <h2>How To Install Python ? </h2>
    
    <p>You can install python from its official website  <a href = "https://www.python.org/">www.python.org</a>.<br><br>You can also install Python with Anaconda Python distribution.It comes with many pre-intalled libraries like SciPy, NumPy, Panda, etc.Its official site is <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows">www.anaconda.com</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Basics Of Python</h2>
    
    <h3>Tokens</h3>
    
      <p>Tokens are the smallest individual unit in a program. Python breaks each logical line into a sequence of elementary lexical components known as Tokens. It is also called <i>lexical unit</i>.</p>
    
      <h3>Types Of Tokens</h3>
    <p>1.Keywords&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Identifiers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Literals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.Operators&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.Punctuators</p>

      <h4>Keywords</h4>
      <p>Keyword is a reserved word in a programming language that has a special meaning.They are case sensative.Except True, False and None, all other keywords are lowercase.</p>

      <h4>Identifiers</h4>
      <p>Identifier is a user-defined name to represent variables, objects, functions, lists, classes, tuples, dictionaries, etc.There are various rules for forming identifiers:</p>
      <p><img src="play.png" width="10px" height="10px">An identifier can contain long sequences of letters and digit of any length.</p><p><img src="play.png" width="10px" height="10px">The first charcter can be a letter or an underscore(_).</p>
      <p><img src="play.png" width="10px" height="10px">Digits(0to9)can be used as a part of identifier except for the first character.</p>
      <p><img src="play.png" width="10px" height="10px">A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.</p>
      <p><img src="play.png" width="10px" height="10px">An identifier should not contain special characters except underscore(_).</p>
      <h4>Literals</h4>
      <p>Literals are data items that have a fixed value.</p>
      <h4>Operators</h4>
      <p>Operators are tokens that trigger some computation when applied to variables and other objects in an expression.</p>
      <h4>Punctuators</h4>
      <p>Punctuatos are basically symbols used for defining structures, for expressions, statements, etc.</p>
